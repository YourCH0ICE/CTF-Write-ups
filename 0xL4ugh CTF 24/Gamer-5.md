<h1>Task description:</h1>

Q1 -The attacker scanned a range of IPs, storing the results in a file for exfiltration. What's the full path of the output file, the count of active hosts, and the IP & Port used for exfiltration?

Q2- The attacker established a new account for persistence. Can you disclose the name of the new account and its creation date, please? TimeStamp (UTC) Format : 0xL4ugh{FullPath_Count_IP:Port_username_TimeStamp}

Exmaple: 0xL4ugh{C:**\fileName.ext_0_127.0.0.1:1337_HackerAwyyy_DD-MM-YYYY_HH:MM:SS}

So. I have a file from the first task "Gamer-1".
It's a zip archive which I'll use to find the answers.
