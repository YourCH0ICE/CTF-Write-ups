<h2>Solution:</h2>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>

So, when I had read the task I understood that I have to determine which keys he pressed. But I had no clue how to do it, 'cause I have never worked with it. 
In one moment via scrolling the system files I find the strange .pcap file.

<h3>Step 2:</h3>

Then I had to filter the packets by using the next filter: ```usb.transfer_type == 0x01 and frame.len == 35 and!(usb.capdata == 00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00)```

<h3>Step 3:</h3>

Then I saved the all packets in new .pcap file

<h3>Step 4:</h3>

Then I found a scipt on GitHub which can parse the keyboard button presses. 
```https://github.com/carlospolop-forks/ctf-usb-keyboard-parser```

By using command bellow I could extract the button pressing.

When I had pasted the last command which parse the all information in the plain text â€” I got the flag:

<h3>Step 5:</h3>

<h2>The flag: </h2>

```BITSCTF{I_7h1nk_th3y_4Re_k3yl0991ng_ME!}```
