<h2>Solution:</h2>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>

This task was simple I thought, because I knew that I have to find the suspicious exe file in the system, and I can use the ```volatility3``` to done it. But when I used the plugin ```pstree``` to see the files — I I didn’t find anything strange...

<h3>Step 2:</h3>

Therefore, I decided to check the ```Downloads``` folder to find smth interesting...
I used the Magnet AXIOM to find all artefacts in system and then check the ```Donwloads``` folder.

Here I had found the achive which had inside — the file, called ```steps.pdf.bat```.
On the right side we can see what this file does execute.

<h3>Step 3:</h3>

Whe I had seen the file ```lottery.exe``` I decided that I have to extract this file and upload it to ```VirusTotal``` to see what CVE does this file use.

But using VirusTotal I could't find the ```CVE``` of this file. But I was confident this file is malicious. 

In one moment I realized that we had a .zip archive which used to starting malicious process in the system. So, I had to kept in mind that this ```CVE``` deals with achives. 

<h3>Step 4:</h3>

I had started to surf the internet to find smth about achives and CVE and I found the interesting post.

So, I found the CVE of our exploit.

<h2>The flag:</h2>

```BITSCTF{CVE-2023-38831}```
