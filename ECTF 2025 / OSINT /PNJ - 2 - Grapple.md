<h2>Solution: </h2>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>

In fact, this was the most difficult task for me because I didn’t know what to get hooked on.

There are no pictures of this GRAPPER on the internet. We only know that it can be seen from the Google maps when you walk in the streets. 

<h3>Step 2:</h3>

The assignment said "I visited a museum that reminded me of my childhood, but with bigger machines" this clue was actually helpful, but it confused me in terms of trying to find a museum, Which has old equipment in the form of tractors and other machinery. 
Otherwise I didn’t know which cars were in question. If they are cars, then what is the GRAPPER for? 
Soooo, it was unclear.

As a result, I could not find anything useful.
The organizers published a hint that said "Photo 2 and Photo 5 are linked".

Therefore, I started to search more carefully using Photo-2.

Near this bridge I found a museum, but it was not connected with "Machines". So I continued to search further.

After a while I found a museum with similar exhibitions and which is generally similar to the task description.

The most important thing I noticed is a green fence that has a certain structure

Finally I found it.
I was so happy...
It took a long time, but the task was solved and that’s the main thing.
