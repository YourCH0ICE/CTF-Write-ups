It was a long video on YouTube.

My task was to find the place where the village of Wintergatan is located

<h2>Solution: </h2>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>

For the most part, the video has no important information about geolocation, except for the following timelines:

```1) 5:16 - 5:48```

```2) 13:43 - 14:04```

<h3>Step 2:</h3>

I took enough screenshots to find this place. But the timeline ```14:04``` gave me a direct answer to where it is.
