<h2>Solution: </h2>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>

First of all, I tried to figure out with number 153. I knew, that this task was linked to previous tasks. 
And the point was to understand how previous challs can help us. 

As a result, I realized that all the places we were looking for are in France, this is what was common between all the tasks. 

Besides, it is important that France is divided into separate parts.

<h3>Step 2:</h3> 

Most of the places we found were in the Var (83) department. 
In addition, the task description had the word "dense" that connects with the population or similar things.

Thefore, on this step, I started digging a lot deeper by searching other info about Var department.

At this stage, I understood what is meant by:

Which of the 153 communes has the lowest population density?

<h3>Step 3:</h3> 

I have found the web-site with stats of popultaion in France (Departments, cities etc.)
